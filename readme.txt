 Icebreaker for user engagement



== Description ==



Amplify Connect helps you presents your human face to your users. This encourages people to engage with you. It acts like an ice breaker between you and your site visitors.

People want to connect with real people and not brands. Brands are not people. But brands are made by people. So why not use a real person from your company to represent your brand.
